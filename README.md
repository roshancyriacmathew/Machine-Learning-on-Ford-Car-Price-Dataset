# Machine-Learning-on-Ford-Car-Price-Dataset
Want to learn how to implement machine learning on car price dataset? In this python notebook, we will be implementing 3 different machine learning classifiers on the Ford Car Price prediction dataset available on Kaggle to see which model gives the best model performance. The different machine learning classifiers used in this video include, Linear Regression, XGBoost and Decision tree. The best-performing model will be used to predict the price of new data.
